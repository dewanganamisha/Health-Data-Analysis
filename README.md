# Health-Data-Analysis
#### US Healthcare Case Study
## Overview:
The US healthcare department has shared the hospital data for 100 hospitals, which includes data like patient information, their admission information, and the insurance information. The top executives from the department have a few questions on the data and would like you to analyze and present your findings to them. The analysis should derive meaningful, actionable insights, and the presentation should be clear, complete, and concise.
## Dataset:
Healthcare Dataset
## Problem Statement:
Analyzing the Impact of Demographics and Admission Types on Healthcare Costs and Outcomes

## 1. Demographic Analysis of Medical Conditions
Objective: Identify the most prevalent medical conditions within different demographic groups.
Analysis: Analyze the frequency of each medical condition across different patient demographics. Bucket the demographics to make it presentable to high-level management. Ensure not to create too many buckets and make the buckets mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
## 2. Patient Price Optimization
Objective: Identify trends in the data and recommend ways for patients to reduce their cost.
Analysis: Calculate the average billing amount for different metrics. Determine if certain metrics consistently result in higher or lower healthcare costs. Try to relate it back to findings from the demographic analysis.
